      <h5>1. Terms and Conditions</h5>
      <p>
        How come the tech world produces cutting-edge innovative digital experience, and yet we are still stuck in an
        ancient world of legalese?

        What makes a document legally binding? An ancient language full of “heretofores” and “thereupons” surely does
        not guarantee that.

        That‘s why with Tribevibe we took a step forward and made our Privacy Policy and Terms of User documents
        pleasant to be read. Because our customers deserve it.
